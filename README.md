## BoundCamera.js

**Current Version: 0.1**

Limits the camera from scrolling past boundries other than the edges of the screen. This plugin can limit the view of the player to help create interesting effects, such as expanding the map after a barrier is removed or creating a Zelda 1 style scroll system.
